The AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget allows any visitor to bookmark and share your site easily with many popular services. 

== Description ==
Get more traffic back to your site by installing the AddThis WordPress plugin. With AddThis, your users can promote your content by sharing to 295 of the most popular social networking and bookmarking sites (like Facebook, Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon and MySpace). Our button is small, unobtrusive, quick to load and recognized all over the web.

Optionally, sign up for a free AddThis.com account to see how your visitors are sharing your content: which services they're using for sharing, which content is shared the most, and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is AddThis free? =

Yep! The features you see today on AddThis will always be free. 

= Do I need to create an account? =

No. You only need to create an account if you want to see how your users are sharing your blog; the sharing itself works the same either way.

= Is JavaScript required? =

If you've turned on the drop-down menu (which is recommended, as it's been shown to increase sharing/bookmarking rates), JavaScript must be enabled. We load the actual interface via JavaScript at run-time, which allows us to upgrade the core functionality of the menu itself automatically everywhere.
