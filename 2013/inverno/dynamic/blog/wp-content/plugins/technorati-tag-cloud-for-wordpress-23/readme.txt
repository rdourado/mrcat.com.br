This plugin allows the user to display a Technorati tag cloud instead of the native tag cloud in WordPress 2.3. 

== Description ==
This plugin allows the user to display a Technorati tag cloud instead of the native tags in WordPress 2.3. It uses WordPress 2.3's native tagging/taxonomy system. The formatting of the output is the same as of the native tag cloud system: <code>wp_techtag_cloud();</code>.

Update: The title tag in the links have been updated to reflect the name and not the number of articles with the tag.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip or extract the file wp23techtagcloud.php.
2. Upload the file to your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/)
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Simply paste <code>&lt;?php wp_techtag_cloud(); ?&gt;</code> anywhere in your template to display the tags.

== Support ==
In case this plugin does not work for you, first check if you are using, or have upgraded to WordPress 2.3, as this plugin requires the new tagging system.
