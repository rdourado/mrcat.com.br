This plugin adds a link within each blog post to share blog posts on FaceBook. 

== Installation ==

Installation is fairly simple

1. Upload `facebook-sharer.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you would like to translate the plugin, please use PoEdit or similar to
load the facebook-sharer.pot file. Translate, and save the resulting .mo file
in your plugin directory. I use Icelandic localization code `is_IS` so my .mo
file would be named `facebook-sharer-is_IS.mo`.
